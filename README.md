# mnistNetwork
## Neural Network for the MNIST database using numpy that recognizes numbers from images of handwritten digits
#  Optimized neural network with 98% precision after 20 epochs of training
#  Major changes from v1: - switched from batch gradient descent to mini-batch gradient descent
#                         - added momentum to descent algo
#                         - better initialization of weights
