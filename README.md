# Neural Network for the MNIST database
##  Model recognizes numbers from images of handwritten digits
- Built from scratch with NumPy
- Optimized neural network with 98% precision after 20 epochs of training
- Major changes from v1:
  - switched from batch gradient descent to mini-batch gradient descent
  - added momentum to descent algo
  - better initialization of weights
